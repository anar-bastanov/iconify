  Bigger download, but no .NET runtime required. The exe can be placed anywhere.

- [Latest framework-dependent build](https://github.com/anar-bastanov/run-cat-365-lite/releases/latest/download/RunCat365Lite-runtime-win-x64.zip)  
  Smaller download, but requires the [.NET 9 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0). The exe must stay with the other files from the archive.
